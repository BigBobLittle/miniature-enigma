**Prompt Engineering for RAG**

   To differentiate between the 'write_properly' and 'write_the_same_grammar_fixed' functions using the RAG model, I would design distinct prompts that clearly convey the desired task. For 'write_properly', the prompt should emphasize the need for both grammatical correction and stylistic enhancement, while for 'write_the_same_grammar_fixed', the prompt should focus solely on correcting grammatical errors without modifying the overall style or meaning.

   Example prompts:

   **Write_properly**:
   ```
   You are an expert English language assistant. Your task is to rewrite the given text in a more grammatically correct and stylistically improved manner, while preserving the original meaning. Enhance the text by correcting grammatical errors, improving sentence structure, and making the writing more fluent and natural.

   Here is the text to improve:
   [INPUT_TEXT]
   ```

   **Write_the_same_grammar_fixed**:
   ```
   You are an expert English language assistant. Your task is to correct any grammatical errors in the given text, while preserving the original meaning and style as much as possible. Do not modify the text beyond fixing grammatical mistakes.

   Here is the text to correct:
   [INPUT_TEXT]
   ```

   By explicitly stating the requirements in the prompts, we can help the RAG model understand the distinction between the two tasks and provide the desired output.

**API Utilization Strategy**

   To efficiently and effectively utilize the OpenAI API, I would implement the following strategies:

   1. **Input Text Truncation**: Since the API has limitations on the input length, I would implement a function to truncate overly long input texts while preserving essential context. This could involve splitting the text into smaller chunks and processing them independently.

   2. **Caching and Deduplication**: To avoid redundant API calls and optimize costs, I would implement a caching mechanism to store previously processed inputs and their corresponding outputs. If the same input is encountered again, the cached output can be returned instead of making a new API call.

   3. **Batching**: For scenarios where multiple inputs need to be processed, I would batch them together and send them to the API in a single request, as allowed by the API limits. This can help reduce the overhead of making multiple individual requests.

   4. **Adaptive Tokenization**: Since the API pricing is based on the number of tokens, I would implement adaptive tokenization strategies to optimize the input text representation, potentially reducing the overall cost.

   5. **Error Handling and Retries**: To handle temporary API failures or rate-limiting issues, I would implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to ensure reliable and resilient operation.

**Handling Ambiguity in User Inputs**

   Given that the users are non-native English speakers, their inputs may contain ambiguities or context-specific nuances. To handle such cases, especially for the 'write_properly' function where style improvement is also considered, I would implement the following strategies:

   1. **Context Extraction**: I would design prompts that encourage users to provide additional context or clarification when their input is ambiguous or lacks sufficient information for style improvement.

   2. **Iterative Refinement**: If the initial output from the RAG model is unsatisfactory or ambiguous, I would implement an iterative process where the user can provide feedback or additional context, and the prompt is refined accordingly for subsequent API calls.

   3. **Language Models for Context Understanding**: I would explore the integration of large language models or pre-trained models for tasks like context understanding and ambiguity resolution. These models could help in interpreting the user's intent and providing appropriate style improvements.

   4. **Fallback Strategies**: In cases where ambiguity cannot be resolved, I would implement fallback strategies, such as defaulting to the 'write_the_same_grammar_fixed' function or providing a warning about potential ambiguity in the output.

**Summarization Technique**

For the 'Summarize' function, I would leverage the RAG model's capability to retrieve relevant information from a corpus and generate a concise summary. The approach would involve the following steps:

1. **Corpus Preparation**: I would create or obtain a relevant corpus of high-quality text data related to the domain or topics expected in the user inputs. This corpus would serve as the knowledge base for the RAG model.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: I would design a prompt that instructs the RAG model to generate a concise summary of the input text while retaining the essential points and key information.

Example prompt:
```
You are an expert summarizer. Your task is to provide a concise summary of the given text, capturing the main points and key information while keeping the summary brief and coherent.

Here is the text to summarize:
[INPUT_TEXT]
```

3. **Output Filtering and Post-processing**: Since the RAG model's output may contain irrelevant or redundant information, I would implement filtering and post-processing techniques to refine the summary. This could involve techniques like sentence ranking, information extraction, and redundancy removal.

4. **Length Control**: To ensure the summary is concise, I would set appropriate limits on the maximum output length or token count based on the desired level of brevity.

**Performance Metrics and Evaluation**

To evaluate the performance of each function in this application, I would use the following metrics:

1. **Write_properly and Write_the_same_grammar_fixed**:
   - Human Evaluation: Gather feedback from native English speakers or language experts on the quality of the output, considering factors like grammatical correctness, fluency, and preservation of meaning.
   - Automated Metrics: Utilize existing metrics like GLEU (Google's BLEU) or METEOR to quantitatively measure the similarity between the output and human-provided reference texts.

2. **Summarize**:
   - Human Evaluation: Obtain feedback from users or language experts on the quality of the summaries, considering factors like coherence, informativeness, and conciseness.
   - Automated Metrics: Use metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) or BERTScore to evaluate the quality of the summaries by comparing them with human-written reference summaries.

To continuously improve the system, I would implement a feedback loop where users can provide ratings or comments on the outputs. This feedback, along with the performance metrics, would guide the iterative refinement of the prompts and the overall system.

Prompt engineering would play a crucial role in this process, as refining the prompts based on user feedback and performance analysis can significantly improve the model's understanding and output quality.

Additionally, I would regularly monitor the system's performance, API usage, and costs to identify potential areas for optimization and make necessary adjustments to the API utilization strategies or other components of the application.
